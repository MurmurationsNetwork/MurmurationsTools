## Enabling IPFS

Profiles created in Tools can also be saved to IPFS as well as to your Mongo database. You will need access to an IPFS server and will have to set the credentials in your environment variables file.

You can enable IPFS functionality by changing the configuration in the `app/utils/settings.js` file:

```javascript
export const settings = {
    ipfsEnabled: true
};
```

Then save the file and restart/redeploy the app. To disable IPFS, set `ipfsEnabled` back to false and restart/redeploy again.
